.files
======

Ya'know programmer stuff. The Makefile is used
to link all of the dotfiles into their proper place,
the dotfile was modified off of one auto-generated by a script
I wrote called [dotmake][] which you should check out if you
had as many problems syncing your dotfiles as I did.

Someday I'll write a blog post about why a Makefile is the
superior dotfile linking mechanism, but until then, trust
me... it's the best.
