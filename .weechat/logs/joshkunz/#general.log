2012-10-02 14:06:49	josh	for integrating 4-4x i can just use the power rule right?
2012-10-02 14:06:55	alex	yeah
2012-10-02 14:07:14	alex	don't forget to integrate the 4 term though
2012-10-02 14:07:30	alex	4x - 2x^2
2012-10-02 14:07:58	josh	does the lower bound go on top or bottem of the integral sign?
2012-10-02 14:08:37	alex	read from bottom to top, generally left bound is on the bottom
2012-10-02 14:09:38	josh	have you done the assignment yet?
2012-10-02 14:10:05	alex	not yet
2012-10-02 14:10:16	josh	have you started?
2012-10-02 14:10:17	alex	i have tomorrow off
2012-10-02 14:10:21	alex	a little bit
2012-10-02 14:16:29	josh	i'm not following this...
2012-10-02 14:17:10	josh	so it's the probablility that the student will get a 50%, or 50% chance of passing?
2012-10-02 14:17:29	josh	only scores > .55 are passing.
2012-10-02 14:17:29	alex	i think the question is asking what score 50% of students should get
2012-10-02 14:17:47	alex	or, 50% of students should get or have less than
2012-10-02 14:18:05	josh	so integrate to .5?
2012-10-02 14:18:19	alex	I believe so
2012-10-02 14:18:33	alex	if it were the normal curve, the 50th percentile is the peak
2012-10-02 14:19:47	josh	ok, that's what I was thinking as well... but that doesn't seem to make much sense. But then again I guess a test where students only pass .55% of the time is kind of silly.
2012-10-02 14:21:19	josh	do you follow the forums?
2012-10-02 14:21:25	alex	sometimes
2012-10-02 14:21:43	alex	i usually post/lurk in bursts if/when I do
2012-10-02 14:22:07	josh	nice... I get all the emails... there have been a lot.
2012-10-02 14:22:14	alex	ah, lol

2012-10-02 14:23:00	josh	me too, but I like answering peoples questions
2012-10-02 14:23:06	alex	yeah, that is fun
2012-10-02 14:23:16	alex	i should check it more often

2012-10-02 14:24:54	alex	before it was usually a while after the question before he answered it
2012-10-02 14:25:29	josh	have you heard of pinboard (pinboard.in)
2012-10-02 14:25:41	josh	should say http://pinboard.in
2012-10-02 14:25:42	alex	i haven't
2012-10-02 14:25:45	alex	what is it?
2012-10-02 14:25:58	josh	it's like delicious but better
2012-10-02 14:26:23	josh	the guy who runs it has an entertaining twitter feed
2012-10-02 14:26:32	alex	i never used delicious, what does it do?
2012-10-02 14:27:17	josh	it's a bookmarking site. Lets you store links, tag them, organize them, share them (like a mini social network)
2012-10-02 14:27:27	josh	pinboard will also bookmark them
2012-10-02 14:27:34	josh	*archive them

2012-10-02 14:45:20	alex	how does passcrypt compare to lastpass?
2012-10-02 14:46:05	josh	in no way at all. I needed a way to store general passwords in my dotfiles repo without making it private
2012-10-02 14:46:16	josh	and has a unix command to fetch them
2012-10-02 14:46:48	alex	ahh, yeah

2012-10-02 15:08:10	alex	persistent has two incompatible meanings
2012-10-02 15:08:41	alex	the one that helps with concurrency is about the collection being persistent in memmory, rather than being backed by a database
2012-10-02 15:09:01	josh	Ahh...
2012-10-02 15:09:49	josh	From threaded programming i've done, i always thought that it was considered bad form for threads to share memory objects...
2012-10-02 15:10:02	alex	that's the beauty of persistent collections
2012-10-02 15:10:12	alex	they are effectively immutable
2012-10-02 15:10:30	alex	a change made by one thread won't be seen by another thread
2012-10-02 15:11:05	josh	seems like witchcraft
2012-10-02 15:11:13	alex	it is
2012-10-02 15:11:16	josh	I move to burn...
2012-10-02 15:11:21	alex	lol
2012-10-02 15:12:34	josh	also he was talking about how in C# there is a code block blocking mechanism, doesn't that kind of seem like defeating the purpose of threading?
2012-10-02 15:12:45	josh	everything will still get choked up...
2012-10-02 15:12:48	alex	well the code isn't always locked
2012-10-02 15:12:55	alex	ideally you only lock small blocks
2012-10-02 15:13:24	alex	but someone who favors a functional paradigm would say that locking is a symptom of a bad concurrency model
2012-10-02 15:13:33	josh	or, I don't know primative resource locks like everyone else...
2012-10-02 15:13:36	josh	nice....
2012-10-02 15:14:01	alex	in the presence of immutability, locking is unecessary
2012-10-02 15:14:24	josh	true, but immutability is hard...
2012-10-02 15:14:29	alex	yeah
2012-10-02 15:14:33	josh	:)
2012-10-02 15:15:09	josh	it also doesn't work well when you are working with a limited number of resources...
2012-10-02 15:15:42	alex	well there are some things that you can't really make immutable, like OS resources
2012-10-02 15:16:00	alex	but functional features make immutability much more efficient than just copy on write
2012-10-02 15:16:12	josh	or forks... http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers
2012-10-02 15:16:23	alex	i have seen that problem

2012-10-04 15:18:00	josh	But that's a funadmental problem of general knowladge not method. People think that an OS is part of a computer not software that runs on top.
2012-10-04 15:18:18	josh	why? because of killer program X. (yet to come)

2012-10-25 14:10:14	-->	alex (~alex@128-110-82-5.uconnect.utah.edu) has joined #general
2012-10-25 14:10:18	alex	tada!
2012-10-25 14:10:24	@josh	Wooo!
2012-10-25 14:10:33	@josh	ok so a couple of things:
2012-10-25 14:10:46	@josh	A) the irc server is: git.joshkunz.com
2012-10-25 14:10:57	alex	the irc server?
2012-10-25 14:11:03	alex	or the git server
2012-10-25 14:11:07	@josh	so to clone a repo for example you would do (sorry git server)
2012-10-25 14:11:21	@josh	git clone git@git.joshkunz.com:reponame
2012-10-25 14:11:38	alex	git clone git.joshkunz.com/<reponame>
2012-10-25 14:11:43	alex	lol
2012-10-25 14:11:53	alex	close but wrong
2012-10-25 14:11:54	@josh	B) all of the repos are in the form cs3500/[a-zA-Z0-9]*
2012-10-25 14:12:19	@josh	You can just dynamically create repo's as you please
2012-10-25 14:12:28	@josh	* by cloning them
2012-10-25 14:13:15	@josh	so git clone git@git.joshkunz.com:cs3500/test will create a new repo 'test' automagically.
2012-10-25 14:13:35	alex	lol @automagically
2012-10-25 14:13:50	@josh	Also, I don't know about you, but it sounds like a good idea to get in
2012-10-25 14:14:02	@josh	* the irc server whenever we're working on the project.
2012-10-25 14:14:15	alex	I have access to a teamspeak server
2012-10-25 14:14:27	alex	we could do voice chat
2012-10-25 14:15:07	@josh	I would be totally behind that, except my home internet is horrible.
2012-10-25 14:15:18	alex	that's the great thing about teamspeak
2012-10-25 14:15:27	alex	it's pretty good at minimizing network traffic
2012-10-25 14:15:33	alex	but if it doesn't work it doesn't work
2012-10-25 14:15:45	alex	where is this?
2012-10-25 14:15:50	@josh	My house.
2012-10-25 14:16:11	@josh	Anyways, what's the teamspeak address?
2012-10-25 14:16:19	@josh	(or connection information)
2012-10-25 14:16:26	alex	lemme go look it up
2012-10-25 14:17:14	@josh	Also, i should say that for asyncronus communications email is by far the best way to reach me (joshkunz@me.com I think you have the wrong address).
2012-10-25 14:17:26	alex	server is lithium.typefrag.com:27535
2012-10-25 14:17:39	alex	yeah, gmail just knew your other email and I was in a hurry
2012-10-25 14:17:46	@josh	Oh ok.
2012-10-25 14:22:58	@josh	Oh my god did you just hear that...
2012-10-25 14:23:40	@josh	"I'm sure it uses the TCP protocl to connect initially, but then it isnt restricted by protocol"
2012-10-25 14:23:45	@josh	"Sooooooo woroooong"
2012-10-25 14:23:48	alex	I know only a little bit about network stacks
2012-10-25 14:24:09	@josh	tcp is a protocol for the transmission of packets
2012-10-25 14:24:13	alex	right
2012-10-25 14:24:19	alex	udp is like one way isn't it?
2012-10-25 14:24:23	alex	something like that?
2012-10-25 14:24:28	@josh	no udp is 'connectionless'
2012-10-25 14:24:32	alex	ahhh
2012-10-25 14:24:47	alex	does that mean stateless?
2012-10-25 14:24:57	alex	they don't presume any previous connection state?
2012-10-25 14:24:58	@josh	you don't need that
2012-10-25 14:25:20	@josh	it just sends packets to a port at an ip
2012-10-25 14:25:26	@josh	that's why it's less reliable
2012-10-25 14:25:29	alex	tcp establishes a connection first?
2012-10-25 14:25:34	@josh	yea
2012-10-25 14:25:49	@josh	That's the major high-level difference
2012-10-25 14:26:11	@josh	you can also send data of arbitrary size on UDP if I rememeber correctly
2012-10-25 14:26:14	alex	would you use udp to establish a tcp connection?
2012-10-25 14:26:35	@josh	No, you use a special kind of TCP packed.
2012-10-25 14:26:41	@josh	*packet 
2012-10-25 14:26:49	@josh	the SYN packet.
2012-10-25 14:27:13	@josh	it goes SYN -> SYN/ACK <- ACK
2012-10-25 14:27:56	@josh	It's a long and tedious history, but yes for the most part
2012-10-25 14:29:19	@josh	Oh I should add that the reason why thats so wrong, is the fact that the data is sent over the tcp protocol in /another/ protocol. Like http, or smtp or somthing.
2012-10-25 14:29:34	alex	yeah
2012-10-25 14:29:43	alex	that's the whole point of a protocol
2012-10-25 14:29:55	@josh	so in that regaurd you're not restricted by protocol. But you're always using tcp
2012-10-25 14:29:56	alex	that's the 'language' the communication will be in
2012-10-25 14:30:08	@josh	Yea sure, you can think of it like that.
2012-10-25 14:30:27	alex	well are http/smtp layered on tcp or independent?
2012-10-25 14:31:00	@josh	oh it's FIN
2012-10-25 14:31:05	alex	FIN?
2012-10-25 14:31:15	alex	ahh, the initiater packet?
2012-10-25 14:31:20	@josh	yea.
2012-10-25 14:31:52	@josh	Whoops wrong section. FIN is the finish packet
2012-10-25 14:32:07	@josh	I was right it's SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK
2012-10-25 14:32:59	@josh	This is totally funny. I literally just wrote this stuff in C
2012-10-25 14:33:05	alex	lol

2012-10-25 14:48:27	alex	in java == always does reference comparison e.g "are these the same object?"
2012-10-25 14:48:56	@josh	Same in C#
2012-10-25 14:49:03	@josh	(unless you override it)
2012-10-25 14:49:06	alex	c# that's the default behavior
2012-10-25 14:49:08	alex	yeah
2012-10-25 14:49:12	alex	java you can't do operator overloading
2012-10-25 14:49:32	@josh	I actually kind-of like operator overloading
2012-10-25 14:49:40	alex	in my experience == is generally .Equals on standard library classes
2012-10-25 14:49:44	@josh	I think they go a little overboard in Haskell world
2012-10-25 14:50:01	alex	I don't have a huge opinion one way or the other
2012-10-25 14:50:32	@josh	That's funny. In my experince == almost never does reference equality
2012-10-25 14:50:48	@josh	in python reference equality is the keyword 'is'.
2012-10-25 14:51:16	@josh	C doesn't really have objects.
2012-10-25 14:51:43	@josh	javascript "==" does coerce compare ("2" == 2) is true for example.
2012-10-25 14:51:47	alex	yeah
2012-10-25 14:51:58	alex	js is famously weakly typed though
2012-10-25 14:52:29	alex	you can do === in js to do type comparison too
2012-10-25 14:52:36	@josh	IMO it goes beyond weak typing. The idea of javascript is that everything is a string.
2012-10-25 14:52:49	alex	I can go with that
2012-10-25 14:53:14	@josh	And yea I know about ===, in coffeescript it compiles all '==' to ===
2012-10-25 15:07:22	alex	is that a debugger?
2012-10-25 15:07:32	@josh	yea it's gdb
2012-10-25 15:07:39	@josh	the GNUDebugger

2012-11-01 14:27:13	@josh	What is CPS?
2012-11-01 14:27:40	alex	I don't completely understand it
2012-11-01 14:27:48	alex	but it's a different way to handle function calls
2012-11-01 14:28:03	alex	search continuation passing style
2012-11-01 14:28:38	alex	traditionally with function calls, the callee will always return to the caller when it is done
2012-11-01 14:28:45	@josh	I have no Idea
2012-11-01 14:28:56	alex	in CPS, the caller passes a function that the callee should call when it is done
2012-11-01 14:29:38	alex	1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> done VS 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> done
2012-11-01 14:30:12	@josh	So it basically passes an additional 'return' callback right?
2012-11-01 14:30:40	alex	in CPS excecution does not return to the caller unless you explicitly tell it to
2012-11-01 14:32:42	alex	I was thinking idly about how I would do the assignment and I remembered CPS

2012-11-01 16:19:08	alex	ah dang, forgot my question
2012-11-01 16:19:19	alex	so far so good though
2012-11-01 16:19:56	alex	although I am concerned that your object-level string "incoming" may not be thread safe
2012-11-01 16:20:22	alex	not completely sure one way or the other though
2012-11-01 16:21:11	josh	There's only one BeginReceive callback at any one given time, and thus only one thread. (at least thats my reasoning.
2012-11-01 16:21:50	josh	there's only one callback because StringSocket is the only one that calls that method
2012-11-01 16:22:48	alex	but multiple threads could call BeginRecieve on the same StringSocket
2012-11-01 16:23:10	alex	wouldn't there be multiple instances of the callback floating around?
2012-11-01 16:23:46	josh	but StringSocket.BeginReceive just enques callbacks and then runs BeginReceive if there isn't another callback already running.
2012-11-01 16:25:09	josh	It can't start more than one Socket.BeginReceive method
2012-11-01 16:25:49	alex	I'm still not sure

2012-11-06 14:10:50	@josh	speak your mind
2012-11-06 14:10:52	alex	I don't have much laptop battery yet
2012-11-06 14:10:56	alex	er, left
2012-11-06 14:11:10	@josh	nice
2012-11-06 14:11:12	alex	but what were you saying?
2012-11-06 14:11:32	@josh	t's a known problem. If the code receives only newline characters it will only fire
2012-11-06 14:11:32	@josh	  2 off one callback per 1024 bytes, buffering the rest. We need to make a thread or something
2012-11-06 14:11:33	@josh	  3 that clears out the remaining bytes in the buffer.

2012-11-06 14:11:49	alex	I see
2012-11-06 14:25:36	@josh	So on #7 it only stalls on the branches if the prediction is wrong right?

2012-11-06 14:27:01	alex	does it have forwarding? how does it deal with data hazards?
2012-11-06 14:27:38	@josh	yea it has forwarding. Just by nature of the way it's written it avoids data hazards.
2012-11-06 14:27:55	@josh	I'm curious about branches more than anything

2012-11-08 14:07:59	alex	I didn't do so much eh
2012-11-08 14:08:00	josh	What test cases did you put in?
2012-11-08 14:08:12	josh	Just out of curiocity...
2012-11-08 14:08:15	alex	the ones from the forum that weren't repeats and joe's
2012-11-08 14:08:30	josh	Really it had all of joe's cases in it?
2012-11-08 14:08:38	josh	There were only like 5...
2012-11-08 14:08:38	alex	did you run both test files?
2012-11-08 14:08:45	alex	ahhhh
2012-11-08 14:08:45	josh	There were two files?
2012-11-08 14:08:51	alex	yeah
2012-11-08 14:08:58	alex	i was getting name collisions
2012-11-08 14:08:59	josh	I saw two regions...
2012-11-08 14:09:04	alex	hmmm
2012-11-08 14:09:12	josh	but not two files
2012-11-08 14:10:05	alex	I am pretty sure I comitted
2012-11-08 14:10:08	alex	but I could be mistaken
2012-11-08 14:10:13	alex	committed and pushed
2012-11-08 14:10:18	josh	You might not have added that file
2012-11-08 14:11:54	josh	Oh yeah, saturday at 10:00 Engman lab?
2012-11-08 14:12:01	alex	yeah
2012-11-08 14:12:02	josh	Are they open on saturday?
2012-11-08 14:12:08	alex	they have been in the past
2012-11-08 14:12:13	alex	i've done pair programming on weekends before
2012-11-08 14:15:17	josh	Oh man... I think he got the old version...
2012-11-08 14:15:30	josh	At the last second I changed it to use queues for send as well...
2012-11-08 14:15:45	josh	It didn't change any test outcomes...
2012-11-08 14:15:45	alex	he usually doesn't check out right at 10:00
2012-11-08 14:16:04	josh	No, I mean, it's the thursday after, and it's the old version...
2012-11-08 14:17:24	josh	Yea, its the old version. Like I said, I didn't fix any test cases, but I changed it...
2012-11-08 14:17:33	josh	And this is not that version...
2012-11-08 14:18:42	alex	learning about language history makes me really surpised that java was ever relevant
2012-11-08 14:18:49	alex	oooh! garbage collection!
2012-11-08 14:18:57	alex	no languages have that
2012-11-08 14:19:18	josh	Why? Well, like he said, it was basically lisp in the C paradgim[sp]
2012-11-08 14:19:27	alex	I really disagree with that though
2012-11-08 14:19:30	alex	java is nothing like lisp
2012-11-08 14:19:39	josh	It uses the same memory allocation
2012-11-08 14:19:42	alex	that's true
2012-11-08 14:19:56	alex	I think that automatic garbage collection is not what lisp is really about
2012-11-08 14:20:02	alex	just a nice thing it had early on
2012-11-08 14:20:04	josh	That was one of lisps major features, why the heap is called a "heap"
2012-11-08 14:20:31	alex	but homoiconicity? functional programming? macros?
2012-11-08 14:20:44	josh	I agree, it was way ahead of it's time..
2012-11-08 14:21:20	josh	simply the fact that it's still relavent today proves that... Nobody even really had uses for all of these language features yet...
2012-11-08 14:21:38	alex	I think people were taking advantage of metaprogramming pretty early on
2012-11-08 14:21:49	alex	I just think it's hard to think in the functional paradigm
2012-11-08 14:22:14	josh	Lisp was basically the first really functional programing language..
2012-11-08 14:22:45	josh	Think about it.
2012-11-08 14:23:32	josh	Functional programming was brand new when lisp came out, people were still figuring out how to program in OO when lisp was around.

2012-11-08 14:25:46	josh	people are being trained in OO to support legacy systems, and being taught by old school professionals...
2012-11-08 14:26:03	alex	and so the cycle continues forevermore
2012-11-08 14:26:07	josh	:)
2012-11-08 14:26:25	alex	almost all the professors here are OO types
2012-11-08 14:26:30	alex	there's one functional guy thouhg
2012-11-08 14:27:03	josh	OO ( and sort of weak-style functional programming) has a lot of benifits for stateful operations (reading, writing, things like that)
2012-11-08 14:27:14	josh	*GUI's
2012-11-08 14:27:29	alex	i've heard the argument that guis were responsible for the rise of OO
2012-11-08 14:27:40	josh	It seems like a valid argument...
2012-11-08 14:27:49	alex	I'm not convinced those can't be done just as well in functional code
2012-11-08 14:27:56	alex	just not as easy to think about
2012-11-08 14:28:58	josh	functional code abhores stateful operations, the fundamental concepts begin to break down it you can have functions that don't return the same thing with the same input.
2012-11-08 14:29:11	alex	right, referential transparency
2012-11-08 14:29:16	josh	It can be done, but I agree, much more complicated.
2012-11-08 14:29:28	alex	haskell manages to do gui stuff somehow doesn't it?
2012-11-08 14:29:41	josh	And complication, generally fosters more errors.
2012-11-08 14:29:55	josh	Yea, haskell has Monads though...
2012-11-08 14:29:57	alex	I don't know if it's complicated in that way
2012-11-08 14:30:12	alex	just not as immediately intuitive
2012-11-08 14:30:24	alex	I could be wrong though
2012-11-08 14:31:42	josh	The beauty of functional programming is that it is hard to get it wrong once you get it right? You know what I mean?
2012-11-08 14:32:35	josh	That's the point, as long as you carefully design your interface, it will work extremely well, designing the interface is the hard part...

2012-11-08 14:39:15	alex	how did you lke the 3810 test?
2012-11-08 14:39:23	josh	I thought is was really easy.
2012-11-08 14:39:31	alex	yeah, definitely easier than I expected
2012-11-08 14:39:36	josh	What did you get for the last problem?
2012-11-08 14:39:46	alex	the pipelining one?
2012-11-08 14:39:57	josh	Yea, where you had to figure out the delay...
2012-11-08 14:40:07	alex	I got a penalty of 2 cycles

2012-11-08 14:40:23	alex	screw that problem

2012-11-08 14:40:28	alex	the second way to detect overflow?
2012-11-08 14:40:32	alex	took me forever

2012-11-08 14:40:47	josh	I only got one...
2012-11-08 14:40:52	alex	so for the first, you know there is underflow if there isn't a carry out bit
2012-11-08 14:41:01	josh	good, I got that one at least
2012-11-08 14:41:31	alex	I said that if A31 and B31 were the same, R31 had to be 0

2012-11-13 11:56:11	josh	:)
2012-11-13 11:56:30	oijerow	I like to purposely fill my grammar with inconsistencies and incorrectness like that
2012-11-13 11:56:38	derpy	yea you can look at paintings and see if it looks like what it is but what about abstract art
2012-11-13 11:56:56	oijerow	Its like a relief from lives
2012-11-13 11:57:13	oijerow	paintings is the stufff
2012-11-13 11:57:20	josh	Abstract art is meant to represetitive of some larger idea. If it fails at that, it's bad.
2012-11-13 11:57:35	derpy	only if it's a definable idea
2012-11-13 11:57:43	josh	(Yes it's much harder to fail at that)
2012-11-13 11:58:22	derpy	For me the difference is that a painting (or any work) is created by the artist; it?s the expressive nature of the medium that makes something art. In that way I think any work that touches us on an emotional level ? brings us joy or anger, tears or laughter ? is art. But there is a cultural aspect to it as well, particularly in how we interpret art. Some works can be so foreign that they?re lost in translation to different countr
2012-11-13 11:58:23	derpy	ies, and sometimes what?s considered art by one group of people can be offensive to another.
2012-11-13 11:58:31	oijerow	did salvador dali have a larger idea with the melted things?
2012-11-13 11:58:37	derpy	yes

2012-11-13 11:59:34	oijerow	there was more than just clocks that was weird
2012-11-13 11:59:36	derpy	he was a surrealist they worked to anilize the way people think
2012-11-13 12:00:34	derpy	look up the betrayal of images
2012-11-13 12:00:49	derpy	it's a good representation of the movement

2012-11-20 14:44:06	jeff	assembly is probably the biggest help for understanding the stack and such
2012-11-20 14:44:21	jeff	not the heap of course
2012-11-20 14:44:51	josh	It's cause the heap is managed by the language. But, yea I agree.
2012-11-20 14:45:16	josh	Why is he going into ultra-fine detail do you think?
2012-11-20 14:45:50	jeff	dunnp
2012-11-20 14:46:00	jeff	*dunno
2012-11-20 14:46:16	jeff	maybe he doesnt have anything else to teach us
2012-11-20 14:46:18	jeff	lol
2012-11-20 14:46:30	jeff	apparently we are supposed to go over intellectual property at some point oo

2012-11-20 14:47:00	jeff	lol
2012-11-20 14:47:24	josh	True that.
2012-11-20 14:48:18	jeff	so apparently my ubuntu thinks I'm getting no signal from the wifi
2012-11-20 14:48:22	jeff	but yet.. here I am
2012-11-20 14:48:24	jeff	lol
2012-11-20 14:49:09	josh	Are you guys thinking about doing some kind of 'alternate' project for PS9?
2012-11-20 14:49:16	jeff	hmmm
2012-11-20 14:49:22	jeff	doubtful, if I had more time I would
2012-11-20 14:49:41	jeff	doing it in java wouldnt be particularly difficult
2012-11-20 14:49:43	jeff	you?
2012-11-20 14:50:40	josh	We were thinking of doing a web application or some language neither of us know. Like maybe rust or Haskell
2012-11-20 14:50:51	jeff	haha nice
2012-11-20 14:51:22	jeff	haskell has networking?
2012-11-20 14:51:34	josh	Haskell has everything.

2012-11-20 14:54:17	josh	meeting in person is so 2 hours ago.
2012-11-20 14:54:23	jeff	true that
2012-11-20 14:54:40	jeff	we hipsters have nothing to do with that 2 hours ago crap
2012-11-20 14:54:53	josh	These blue arrows on blue background are awlful
2012-11-20 14:55:19	jeff	lol yes they are
2012-11-20 14:55:35	 *	jeff has no idea where the arrows are going
2012-11-20 14:56:03	josh	This seems like a really complicated way of explaining this...
2012-11-20 14:56:37	jeff	yes
2012-11-20 14:56:47	jeff	thats all I have to say to that
2012-11-20 14:57:59	josh	It's basically, if this is typed as an interface, and the code wants to call method j, method j of the interface point to j. Boom
2012-11-20 14:58:40	jeff	yepp
2012-11-20 14:58:56	jeff	so apparently we are using c++ in 3505?
2012-11-20 14:58:58	josh	"In this case there would be no confusion at all" riiiiight...
2012-11-20 14:59:02	jeff	lol
2012-11-20 14:59:24	josh	And yes we are. With *sigh* C# for guis.

2012-11-20 14:59:42	jeff	I was hoping to get away from window
2012-11-20 14:59:44	jeff	*windows
2012-11-20 14:59:53	josh	I know tell me about it.
2012-11-20 15:00:16	jeff	I would love to know what we gain by making more gui's in c#... lol
2012-11-20 15:00:16	josh	Maybe I can ditch Visual Studio though, that would be pretty cool.
2012-11-20 15:00:21	jeff	yeah
2012-11-20 15:00:31	jeff	GUI's are so... 10 years ago
2012-11-20 15:00:33	jeff	lol
2012-11-20 15:00:44	josh	The visual GUI editor. It makes GUI's like 400x easier.
2012-11-20 15:00:59	jeff	yeah
2012-11-20 15:02:18	josh	> First GUI: 1981 try 30 years ago.
2012-11-20 15:02:31	jeff	yeah..
2012-11-20 15:03:00	jeff	I just dont see us needed to be able to write traditional gui's in the "real world"
2012-11-20 15:03:31	jeff	if you are writing in java/c#, its probably to make a backend webservice or something
2012-11-20 15:03:51	josh	Hahaha, except for at least half of the programs I use.
2012-11-20 15:04:03	jeff	most people interact with websites or apps nowadays
2012-11-20 15:04:19	jeff	well power users interact with a lot more stuff
2012-11-20 15:04:33	josh	Thanks? :)
2012-11-20 15:04:40	jeff	haha
2012-11-20 15:04:49	jeff	good job interacting with a lot of stuff?
2012-11-20 15:05:10	josh	Although I really think that GUI design should really be it's own field.
2012-11-20 15:05:31	josh	Hell Yes!!

2012-11-27 11:51:25	josh	someone visited my website: http://pychannel.joshkunz.com/boards/test#posts
2012-11-27 11:51:31	josh	that's pretty surprising.
2012-11-27 11:52:06	brian	it was me
2012-11-27 11:52:37	 *	brian surprises josh
2012-11-27 11:53:06	josh	brian: really?
2012-11-27 11:53:15	josh	brian: cool!
2012-11-27 11:54:52	brian	did we do much corispondance by email or was it all thourgh chat
2012-11-27 11:55:09	josh	Ohhh.... It was through chat, and email I guess.
2012-11-27 11:55:22	josh	I have logs of the chat I we want to use them.
2012-11-27 11:55:47	josh	*if
2012-11-27 11:56:02	josh	The problem is all of our changes and planning is in google docs.
2012-11-27 11:56:03	jeff	haha
2012-11-27 11:56:07	josh	Versioned.
2012-11-27 11:56:17	jeff	yeah but we can pull out a bunch of our google docs
2012-11-27 11:56:24	brian	that might not be a good idea
2012-11-27 11:56:25	jeff	at least we have planning docs for each of the piece of the project
2012-11-27 11:56:26	josh	jeff: It's fun to imagine that we turn in the irc logs.
2012-11-27 11:56:36	josh	jeff: Do We?
2012-11-27 11:56:44	brian	i gues google does have coppies of all our revisions
2012-11-27 11:56:56	josh	jeff: Is this only for the SLP?
2012-11-27 11:57:02	brian	yes
2012-11-27 11:57:05	jeff	josh: we could turn in a piece of the irc
2012-11-27 11:57:05	josh	brian: Yea, they do.
2012-11-27 11:57:14	jeff	josh: just to explain our use of it
2012-11-27 11:57:29	jeff	but I have the initial emails between us and the NPO
2012-11-27 11:57:42	jeff	so those emails, plus google docs, plus a little IRC is probably good enough
2012-11-27 12:00:22	jeff	k so remember we are second
2012-11-27 12:00:30	brian	an entire chat log and not one peice of usefull information
2012-11-27 12:01:02	josh	brian: an /entire/ chat log.

2012-12-04 11:22:24	josh	It's black. Like the most expensive pahphlet possible.
2012-12-04 11:23:13	josh	4 fonts inconsistent whitespace, (in the pamphlet and presentation) pre-pharmacy majors they are.
2012-12-04 11:24:03	josh	I've seen different kinds of top-level bullet points...

2012-12-04 11:32:04	josh	Do you think they got someone else to do the website? It looked better than the other stuff IMO.
2012-12-04 11:34:17	josh	the four CS Majors are the ones who didn't do a website.

2012-12-04 11:43:55	josh	Look the headings are different.

2012-12-06 14:45:03	josh	* LOCK
2012-12-06 14:45:27	josh	What's the question?
2012-12-06 14:45:47	alex	can you lock and object rather than a block of code
2012-12-06 14:45:58	josh	That's a silly question.
2012-12-06 14:46:13	josh	You can lock the 'entrance' to an object, which is a block of code.
2012-12-06 14:46:24	josh	Which effecitivly locks the object.
2012-12-06 14:46:44	josh	An object is just code tied to memory.
2012-12-06 14:47:10	alex	well I also think that if you used the same object in locks in different parts of the code you would only be able to access the object from one of those blocks with one thread at a time
2012-12-06 14:47:31	josh	We're talking about C# lock statement here?
2012-12-06 14:47:36	alex	I think so
2012-12-06 14:47:41	alex	I don't know so well how it works
2012-12-06 14:48:19	josh	Yea, but that's beacause of C# implementation of the lock statement, not locks in general.
2012-12-06 14:48:25	alex	fair enough
2012-12-06 14:49:50	josh	Primarily at the end of the day, the C# lock statment is just locking memory access to the object.
2012-12-06 14:50:01	josh	At the low level.
2012-12-06 14:50:41	josh	I need to read this some day.
2012-12-06 14:51:00	josh	This is apparently the definitive guide to locking.
2012-12-06 14:51:37	josh	Look it's only 300 pages.
2012-12-06 14:52:11	alex	lol only
2012-12-06 14:52:14	alex	but yeah
2012-12-06 14:52:43	alex	300 isn't bad for a programming book
2012-12-06 14:52:49	josh	I guess not.
2012-12-06 14:53:02	josh	My python phrasebook is only 90 pages or so.
2012-12-06 14:53:12	alex	does it give any instructions/examples?
2012-12-06 14:53:24	josh	That's all it gives.
2012-12-06 14:53:37	alex	I think the python documentation is pushing 200 from what I remember
2012-12-06 14:53:43	josh	It's just a book of design patterns
2012-12-06 14:53:56	josh	alex: I wouldn't be suprised
