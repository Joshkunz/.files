2012-11-15 14:03:23	@josh	Hai
2012-11-15 14:03:26	alex	haysup
2012-11-15 14:03:27	--	Mode #cs3500 [-o josh] by josh
2012-11-15 14:03:57	josh	So the /proc filesystem is a virtual filestem that has stats
2012-11-15 14:04:00	josh	for the system.
2012-11-15 14:04:07	josh	thats how programs like ps work.
2012-11-15 14:04:15	josh	They parse this filesystem.
2012-11-15 14:04:34	alex	so you can then access it and pipe your stats to the status bar?
2012-11-15 14:04:35	josh	because on linux everything is a file system.
2012-11-15 14:04:44	josh	Nononono...
2012-11-15 14:05:06	josh	I'm just using it to figure out network transfer statistics
2012-11-15 14:05:21	alex	aye, that's what I meant
2012-11-15 14:05:32	alex	what was his question?
2012-11-15 14:08:43	alex	what did you say?
2012-11-15 14:11:05	josh	web client -> http webapp -> boggle server
2012-11-15 14:11:33	josh	The http webapp would handle upgrading to websocket

2012-11-15 14:17:10	josh	I think that websockify might work?
2012-11-15 14:17:13	josh	*.
2012-11-15 14:17:37	-->	alex (~alex@128-110-64-59.uconnect.utah.edu) has joined #cs3500
2012-11-15 14:17:44	alex	it looked pretty promising
2012-11-15 14:30:19	alex	it is looking like you need to run both client and server side code
2012-11-15 14:31:26	josh	Yea, that's what I was talking about.
2012-11-15 14:32:33	alex	ahh, I thought we were thinking that perhaps this websockify would let us run code only on the client
2012-11-15 14:32:51	alex	what restrictions are there on your amazon server?
2012-11-15 14:33:02	josh	None whatsoever
2012-11-15 14:33:06	alex	nice
2012-11-15 14:33:17	josh	Well, maybe hardware speed.
2012-11-15 14:33:25	alex	is it a VPS?
2012-11-15 14:33:29	josh	Yea.
2012-11-15 14:33:34	alex	very nice
2012-11-15 14:33:48	josh	Why? a physical server would be much better.
2012-11-15 14:34:00	alex	and much much more expensive
2012-11-15 14:34:18	josh	Yea, that's why I don't have one.
2012-11-15 14:35:02	alex	is it a true VM? can you administrate it via ssh/remote desktop?
2012-11-15 14:35:14	josh	Yep.
2012-11-15 14:35:19	josh	I wouldn't use it otherwise.
2012-11-15 14:35:24	alex	I didn't realize it was that cool
2012-11-15 14:35:56	josh	By the way, I have another host that lets me administrate via ssh and is not a VPS.
2012-11-15 14:36:08	alex	hmmmm
2012-11-15 14:36:42	alex	to me, being able to ssh into something suggests that it's a proper computer
2012-11-15 14:36:50	josh	The key difference being that amazon will let me do whatever I want (intstall whatever I want, run as root, run whatever I want).
2012-11-15 14:36:55	alex	ahhh
2012-11-15 14:36:58	josh	The other host does not.
2012-11-15 14:37:05	alex	root access then?
2012-11-15 14:37:14	alex	so on the other one you're just a reg. user
2012-11-15 14:37:37	josh	To the amazon server? Yes, sort-of, it's more than that though.
2012-11-15 14:38:12	josh	On the other, I'm not a root, but thats not the defining feature.
2012-11-15 14:39:02	alex	so the other one you don't have a whole VM all to yourself then? and on amazon you do?
2012-11-15 14:39:10	josh	Yea, basically.
2012-11-15 14:53:14	alex	so i'm obviously not as comfortable in python as c# but I think it would be fun to try
2012-11-15 14:53:20	alex	it's up to you, I wouldn't be as much help
2012-11-15 14:53:39	josh	haha, that's why I wanted to do it in Objective-C
2012-11-15 14:53:43	josh	:)
2012-11-15 14:53:55	alex	ahh, i see
2012-11-15 14:54:19	josh	Python sucks for GUIs though...
2012-11-15 14:54:33	alex	none of the available toolkits are good?
2012-11-15 14:54:35	josh	(most cross-platform GUI's do)
2012-11-15 14:54:47	josh	No none of them are good.
2012-11-15 14:55:08	alex	i have never checked them out
2012-11-15 14:55:17	alex	but that isn't too surprising
2012-11-15 14:55:35	josh	Should we write a java gui in clojure
2012-11-15 14:55:37	josh	?
2012-11-15 14:55:45	alex	do you like swing?
2012-11-15 14:55:53	alex	we certainly could, clojure's java interop is pretty good
2012-11-15 14:55:59	josh	I've never done any gui stuff in java
2012-11-15 14:56:08	alex	I would say the toolkit is decent
2012-11-15 14:56:20	alex	but there's no drag n drop designer that i'm aware of
2012-11-15 14:56:22	josh	Should we both use a new language, and write a gui in scala?
2012-11-15 14:56:33	alex	I actually know a bit of scala as well
2012-11-15 14:56:37	alex	it's a cool language though
2012-11-15 14:56:42	josh	*sigh*...
2012-11-15 14:56:47	josh	Ummm, Malbolge?
2012-11-15 14:56:48	alex	not too much though
2012-11-15 14:56:50	alex	lolwut?
2012-11-15 14:56:56	alex	oh, i know
2012-11-15 14:56:59	alex	how about groovy?
2012-11-15 14:57:10	josh	Sure, I don't know anyting about groovy
2012-11-15 14:57:25	josh	We could write it in Jython.
2012-11-15 14:57:25	alex	it's a scripting language that runs on the jvm
2012-11-15 14:57:28	alex	also true
2012-11-15 14:58:07	josh	What is groovy, like ruby for jvm?
2012-11-15 14:58:29	josh	(Thats what it looks like to me anyways)
2012-11-15 14:58:36	alex	i think it's more like java + dynamic scripting features
2012-11-15 14:59:07	josh	It looks like it has first class functions as well.
2012-11-15 14:59:11	josh	It's like java 2.0
2012-11-15 14:59:13	alex	yeah
2012-11-15 14:59:18	alex	i've heard good things about it
2012-11-15 14:59:21	alex	just never bothered
2012-11-15 14:59:44	josh	Haha, should we do something rediculous and write the whole thing in x86?
2012-11-15 14:59:59	josh	or LOLCODE or ws or something.
2012-11-15 15:00:27	josh	(or Haskell :) )
2012-11-15 15:00:34	alex	haskell would be fun too
2012-11-15 15:00:40	alex	erlang?
2012-11-15 15:01:56	alex	haskell has a native gui library?
2012-11-15 15:02:24	josh	No it uses the main cross platform ones: Wx Qt and GTK
2012-11-15 15:02:28	josh	*GTK+
2012-11-15 15:02:37	alex	I thought you didn't like those?
2012-11-15 15:02:50	josh	oh, and Cocoa
2012-11-15 15:02:56	josh	apparently
2012-11-15 15:03:10	josh	yea, I don't like them very much, no.
2012-11-15 15:03:17	josh	*strike that last no
2012-11-15 15:03:32	alex	what is it about them that you don't like?
2012-11-15 15:03:32	josh	*it doesn't make any sense
2012-11-15 15:04:03	josh	They tend to make sub-par guis on every platform, instead of good gui's on one.
2012-11-15 15:04:08	alex	ahh, yes
2012-11-15 15:04:15	alex	"write once, debug everywhere"
2012-11-15 15:04:23	josh	nice.
2012-11-15 15:04:46	alex	tcl eh?
2012-11-15 15:04:51	alex	now things are getting crazy
2012-11-15 15:05:03	alex	how about perl then?
2012-11-15 15:05:18	josh	It tcl integrates with Tk, perl doesn't
2012-11-15 15:05:31	josh	*strike the It as well.
2012-11-15 15:05:36	alex	I was just joking
2012-11-15 15:05:46	alex	is Tk good?
2012-11-15 15:06:08	josh	Not what i've seen, but maybe I just suck at it.
2012-11-15 15:07:15	josh	java makes the best non-native GUI's I've seen so far.
2012-11-15 15:07:25	josh	At leat they are constant across platforms.
2012-11-15 15:07:45	alex	we could go with groovy or scala
2012-11-15 15:07:53	alex	I'm not even that good at clojure
2012-11-15 15:07:58	josh	scala if anything.
2012-11-15 15:07:59	alex	I just love it's lispyness
2012-11-15 15:08:18	josh	Ohhhhhh maaaaan. We could write it in rust.
2012-11-15 15:08:23	alex	ohhh
2012-11-15 15:08:25	alex	hmmmm
2012-11-15 15:09:51	alex	I would bet that rust has the same issues as haskel or python

2012-11-20 14:38:47	@alex	haysup
2012-11-20 14:39:13	josh	I posted a question on the forum asking what we could do for PS9. No responses...
2012-11-20 14:39:31	@alex	as far as what tech we could write it in?
2012-11-20 14:39:39	@alex	#general
2012-11-20 14:39:50	@alex	how do you see both channels?
2012-11-20 14:40:26	josh	you have to switch between buffers.
2012-11-20 14:40:49	@alex	how do you do that?
2012-11-20 14:40:52	josh	I don't know how to do it with the default bindings. I remapped.
2012-11-20 14:41:02	@alex	do vim bindings no doubt?
2012-11-20 14:41:04	@alex	*to
2012-11-20 14:41:05	josh	And yes, I asked about the tech.
2012-11-20 14:41:16	josh	No, actaully. Weechat isn't modal
2012-11-20 14:41:21	@alex	ahhh
2012-11-20 14:41:24	@alex	yeah
2012-11-20 14:42:09	@alex	maybe we should ask after class about whether we can do it in another language
2012-11-20 14:42:36	josh	Or the webapp :)
2012-11-20 14:42:44	josh	although that's gonna be a ton of work.
2012-11-20 14:43:48	@alex	with the webapp would we have to have a 2nd server still?
2012-11-20 14:44:26	josh	At least. It looks like it's basically impossible to do raw tcp from js running in a browser.
2012-11-20 14:45:08	@alex	my concern with that is that the university firewall might shoot us down
2012-11-20 14:45:35	josh	No, it'll run over port 80. Port 80 is always open.
2012-11-20 14:46:01	josh	We'll just have problems connection to other peoples servers, and those will be from outside the firewall
2012-11-20 14:46:20	@alex	say the TAs want to test on the same machine
2012-11-20 14:46:31	@alex	js -> intermediate server, just fine
2012-11-20 14:46:44	@alex	intermediate server -> back to client is where I see the problems
2012-11-20 14:47:13	josh	I'm guessing that if we write it in some language other than C# the ta's aren't really going to be doing any testing...
2012-11-20 14:47:19	@alex	ahhh
2012-11-20 14:47:23	@alex	that is possible
2012-11-20 14:47:32	@alex	you think we'll have to demonstrate it personally?
2012-11-20 14:47:47	josh	It depends how complicated it is :)
2012-11-20 14:47:48	@alex	or we'll just get full points by default :P
2012-11-20 14:48:18	josh	I think we'll need to demonstrate that it actaully lets you play a game.
2012-11-20 14:48:23	@alex	yeah
2012-11-20 14:48:32	josh	I don't think they can really grade past that.
2012-11-20 14:49:14	@alex	well they can try various connect/disconnect combinaitons to try and break it
2012-11-20 14:49:54	josh	Sure, they're also lazy, so they're not going to try anything crazy.
2012-11-20 14:51:05	josh	*and by lazy, I mean they have like 200 of these to grade.
2012-11-20 14:51:10	@alex	yeah
2012-11-20 14:51:17	@alex	well maybe 50 apiece
2012-11-20 14:51:26	josh	That's still a ton :)
