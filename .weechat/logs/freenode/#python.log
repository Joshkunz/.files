2012-10-01 04:26:16	Yhg1s	natim: and it isn't launched "for 'from package.name import foobar'", it hooks into imports by mucking with .pth files, import hooks and the __path__ of packages you import.
2012-10-01 04:26:39	Yhg1s	natim: perhaps you should stop trying to explain how your'e trying to solve your problem, and explain what your actual problem is.

2012-10-01 04:30:55	Yhg1s	ok, so you should realize you're not using the "Python namespace package functionality". You're using the *setuptools* namespace functionality. Lots of things won't work right with it.
2012-10-01 04:31:09	Yhg1s	I would recommend not trying to use its namespace functionality with things that break when using it.
