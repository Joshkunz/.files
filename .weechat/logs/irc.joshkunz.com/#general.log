2012-11-19 20:31:07	jeff	so... apparently I dont remember my password for my public key
2012-11-19 20:31:20	jeff	could you throw my new key up for me?
2012-11-19 20:31:53	josh	Sure just email it...
2012-11-19 20:33:37	jeff	done
2012-11-19 20:35:39	josh	ok try it now
2012-11-19 20:38:43	jeff	cool worked
2012-11-19 20:44:12	josh	Hey is there a way you can put a yellow box /behind/ the text in gimp?
2012-11-19 20:45:54	jeff	sure, which text?
2012-11-19 20:46:30	josh	I'm trying to figure out a way to highlight the changes in the newsletter
2012-11-19 20:46:41	jeff	ahh
2012-11-19 20:46:53	jeff	does beamer not give a good way to do it?
2012-11-19 20:47:10	josh	More so latex doesn't give a good way to do it.
2012-11-19 20:47:28	josh	But yea...
2012-11-19 20:48:07	jeff	what about this?  http://www.slideshare.net/linjaaho/how-to-make-boxed-text-with-latex
2012-11-19 20:49:25	josh	ahh, I didn't think of using framed
2012-11-19 20:49:30	josh	I'll try it.
2012-11-19 20:50:33	josh	I've pushed some changes to the repo, so you can see what I'm thinking.
2012-11-19 20:51:41	jeff	alright ill update
2012-11-19 20:57:21	josh	It's not liking it...
2012-11-19 20:57:37	jeff	hmm
2012-11-19 20:58:04	josh	How hard would it be for you to add it?
2012-11-19 21:01:36	jeff	only issue is that its mostly pdf's
2012-11-19 21:02:10	jeff	I could either take the images in the /images folder and edit them
2012-11-19 21:02:18	jeff	then we include it into the presentation
2012-11-19 21:02:26	jeff	or try to edit the presentation as a whole
2012-11-19 21:02:43	jeff	it would be easier to do each image individually
2012-11-19 21:04:22	josh	Each image individually is preferable. I just have them in pdf's because they are easy to work with/that's what I had.
2012-11-19 21:05:05	josh	plus for multi-page files I have an easy way to reference each page individually without any page1 page2 nonsense.
2012-11-19 21:05:25	jeff	yeah
2012-11-19 21:06:16	jeff	but if I edit a two page pdf with gimp it will be hard to publish it back into a 2 page pdf correctly
2012-11-19 21:09:29	josh	When I did it, I made each page a layer, saved the layers individually to pdfs, and then re-joined them outside. I can do the re-joining part (or you can it's just the pdfjoin command)
2012-11-19 21:18:00	jeff	I dunno, it seems like it would be an inordinate amount of work to add comments like that
2012-11-19 21:18:17	josh	Not comments, just coloring.
2012-11-19 21:18:49	jeff	im confused, so coloring what words exactly?
2012-11-19 21:19:00	josh	The changed words.
2012-11-19 21:19:56	josh	So the changes are colored, there are not comments on the slides, we just actually say what we changed.
2012-11-19 21:20:05	jeff	ah so like the online article page
2012-11-19 21:20:20	josh	Yea.
2012-11-19 21:20:45	josh	I also highlighed formatting changes for the newsletter...
2012-11-19 21:22:35	jeff	so, just the brochure that still needs highlighting?
2012-11-19 21:22:56	jeff	lol sorry I was totally not thinking of the same thing as you
2012-11-19 21:23:18	jeff	btw I commited some small changes
2012-11-19 21:23:43	josh	The newsletter highlighting is messed up. The text is lighter and the "highlighing" is just a slightly transparent box over the text which is not ideal...
2012-11-19 21:25:19	josh	did you push them to the server?
2012-11-19 21:25:23	josh	(the changes)
2012-11-19 21:25:27	jeff	I think so
2012-11-19 21:25:35	jeff	ah wait a sec
2012-11-19 21:25:36	josh	it doesn't look like it...
2012-11-19 21:25:51	jeff	just did it
2012-11-19 21:26:04	jeff	still need to get used to the two stage process with git
2012-11-19 21:26:13	jeff	I did git commit but not git push
2012-11-19 21:26:15	jeff	lol
2012-11-19 21:26:31	josh	Technically its one-stage two repo but whatever :)
2012-11-19 21:26:53	josh	What do you think we should do about the "Documents page"
2012-11-19 21:27:14	josh	any fancy image stuff is gonna be rediculiously hard...
2012-11-19 21:27:29	josh	like we might as well do it in an image editor hard.
2012-11-19 21:30:00	jeff	yeah
2012-11-19 21:30:07	jeff	do you want me to do that real quick?
2012-11-19 21:30:14	jeff	lay it out like in the storyboard?
2012-11-19 21:30:42	josh	I don't know if I'm a huge fan of the 'triad' :)
2012-11-19 21:31:48	jeff	haha well
2012-11-19 21:31:52	josh	What do you think of this: The first page of all of the finals in a row, with a caption that says what they are?
2012-11-19 21:32:03	jeff	sure
2012-11-19 21:32:05	josh	I can do that pretty easily.
2012-11-19 21:32:07	jeff	sounds good to me
2012-11-19 21:32:16	josh	(In latex)
2012-11-19 21:33:05	josh	Ok. What do we need to do after the hilighing on newsletter is fixed and the documents page is fixed?
2012-11-19 21:39:01	jeff	hmmm
2012-11-19 21:52:02	jeff	k I just pushed out the new newsletter changes
2012-11-19 21:52:19	jeff	not super pretty but... its much more noticable lol
2012-11-19 21:55:10	josh	Any idea why the text gets lighter?
2012-11-19 21:55:52	jeff	is the text lighter?
2012-11-19 21:55:58	jeff	it looks pretty strong to me
2012-11-19 21:56:19	jeff	unless I didnt push the new pdf out correctly
2012-11-19 21:56:27	josh	side-by side compared to the old one?
2012-11-19 21:56:32	josh	it looks really light.
2012-11-19 21:57:28	jeff	ah I think it got a little blurred and such
2012-11-19 21:57:57	jeff	I didnt change anything with the resolution or anything
2012-11-19 21:58:13	josh	any chance you could crank up the DPI?
2012-11-19 21:58:17	jeff	but the process of importing the pdf and then exporting it back out will likely have made it not as clear
2012-11-19 21:58:33	josh	this is all generated so filesize is really no object.
2012-11-19 21:59:04	jeff	yeah I dont think the dpi is the issue
2012-11-19 21:59:38	josh	It's a resolution problem right?
2012-11-19 21:59:54	josh	So increasing the resolution should fix it?
2012-11-19 21:59:54	jeff	im checking
2012-11-19 22:06:38	jeff	K i checked in a new version
2012-11-19 22:06:44	jeff	see if it looks better
2012-11-19 22:07:04	jeff	one sec its still uploading
2012-11-19 22:07:26	jeff	its a bit bigger... lol
2012-11-19 22:08:02	jeff	on import I needed to increase the resolution quite a bit like you said
2012-11-19 22:08:08	jeff	k its should be there
2012-11-19 22:08:57	josh	ok, I'm updating...
2012-11-19 22:10:36	jeff	the big block of text has some white spots... but its as good as its worth getting
2012-11-19 22:11:05	josh	agg... No dice...
2012-11-19 22:11:11	jeff	on my machine it looks crappy zoomed out but decent when you zoom in a bit
2012-11-19 22:11:28	josh	It'll look bad on a big screen...
2012-11-19 22:11:55	jeff	yeah, it doesnt look good from afar...
2012-11-19 22:12:03	josh	here's an Idea, can you just open the original in gimp and then save it?
2012-11-19 22:12:12	josh	I think they're using different fonts.
2012-11-19 22:12:13	jeff	save it as what?
2012-11-19 22:12:17	josh	a pdf.
2012-11-19 22:12:27	josh	just so they are both the same color.
2012-11-19 22:13:09	jeff	alrighty
2012-11-19 22:13:15	jeff	the newsletter-p1 right?
2012-11-19 22:13:55	josh	Can you just do both while you're at it?
2012-11-19 22:14:09	josh	so they're all the same color.
2012-11-19 22:16:29	jeff	you sure it wont be really bad?
2012-11-19 22:17:31	josh	?? How so?
2012-11-19 22:19:18	josh	Ok I fixed up the documents page. I think it looks pretty great.
